# Usage

Goal: Conduct hierarchical linear regressions to examine associations between CSF GAP-43, hippocampal volume (total and subfield volume), and episodic memory performance in older adults.
Original Usage: [all data obtained from ADNI] Predictor variables = demographic variables, APOE4 status, CSF GAP-43, hippocampal volume (total and subfields [subiculum, presubiculum, dentate gyrus, CA1])  Outputs = composite scores of episodic memory

How to Use: 
- To run this code, you will the attached R code and ADNI data (openly available at  https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)
